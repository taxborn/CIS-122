# CIS-122 - Data Structures
My freshman year at MSU, Mankato, I took CIS-122, a data structures course. 

There won't be too many organizational efforts here, except for the following:

1. Quiz - This is where the code for my quiz answers will go
2. MavPASS - This is an extra study session "class", any code written there will go here
3. MVC - Any code written as an MVC webapp will go here.
4. Test - This is currently in a .gitignore, but I will post it when I finish the class.
